Initial Commit - Initiated repo, created 2x components: Landing and Navbar. 
                    Navbar only has placeholder buttons.
                    Landing fetches data from an API and stores it in a useState hook.

Commit 2 - Added function to Landing components to fetch additional info for each item from the initial fetch.
